# Golf Over Africa
#### Santiago Zapata's entry for Ludum Dare 41

The European superpowers have met to decide the future of the African continent... now their leaders face each other in an Open golf tournament to divide the land between themselves!

This is a multiplayer hot-seat game! 2 to 4 players.

# Setup

## 1. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

```npm install``` 

## 3. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.


## 4. Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
